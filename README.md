# Basic Informational Site

My first Node.js project. A basic website with a homepage, an about page, a contact page and a 404 page. The paths to the first three pages are "/", "/about" and "/contact-me", respectively.

The pages are served with the http library and the files are read with the fs library. The HTML and CSS files are very basic, populated with minimal content. The 8080 port is used.
